# bayesian-differential-equations-db

The purpose of bayesian-differential-equations-db is to present Python implementations of scientific time series models from various disciplines.

While the `pints.toy` module already includes a number of simple models and distributions, this repository is intended for more complex models associated with real experimental data.
